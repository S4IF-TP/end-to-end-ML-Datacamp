    "\n",
    "**Feature engineering** is the process of creating features that enhance ML model performance.\n",

    "### Benefits:\n",
    "- ✅ **Simpler models** — easier deployment and maintenance\n",
    "- ✅ **Faster training** — fewer or more relevant features speed up learning\n",
    "- ✅ **Better interpretability** — easier to explain model decisions\n",
    "- ✅ **Improved performance** — capture essential aspects of data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Main Approaches:\n",
    "1. **Modify existing features** — transform, scale, or combine current features\n",
    "2. **Create new features** — engineer completely new variables from raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principle**: More features ≠ better. Select features that capture essential aspects of the data."
