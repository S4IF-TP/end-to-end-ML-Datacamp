    "- Define success metrics\n",

    "### Stage 2: Data Collection & Preparation\n",
    "- Gather necessary patient health data\n",
    "- Clean and preprocess data\n",
    "- Handle missing values, outliers, and biases\n",

    "### Stage 3: Model Development & Tuning\n",
    "- Select appropriate algorithms\n",
    "- Train models\n",
    "- Optimize hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 4: Model Evaluation\n",
    "- Assess performance on test data\n",
    "- Validate generalization to unseen data\n",
    "- Compare to human expert performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 5: Deployment\n",
    "- Make model available for real-time predictions\n",
    "- Ensure reliability and uptime (even at night when ML engineer is unavailable)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Performance Requirements\n",
    "- ✅ **Accuracy**: Match or exceed the performance of a human expert cardiologist\n",
    "- ✅ **Generalization**: Model must generalize to unseen data (new patients)\n",
    "- ✅ **Reliability**: Return timeous predictions whenever required (24/7 availability)\n",

    "- 🔒 **Data Security**: Sensitive training data must be handled in a safe and private environment\n",
    "- 🔒 **Compliance**: Follow healthcare data regulations (e.g., HIPAA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operational Requirements\n",
    "- 📊 **Monitoring**: Deployed model should be monitored continuously\n",
    "- 🔄 **Retraining**: Model should be retrained whenever performance deteriorates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretability Requirements\n",
    "- 🔍 **Explainability**: Cardiologists should be able to understand the model's prediction\n",
