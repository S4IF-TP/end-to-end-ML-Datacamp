    "## Explanation: what the code does and how to adapt it\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save DataFrame to Parquet\n",
    "  - We take a DataFrame (`heart_disease_df` if available, else a synthetic one) and write it to `heart_disease.parquet`.\n",
    "  - Parquet is a columnar, efficient file format well-supported by feature stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Required timestamp columns\n",
    "  - Feast requires an `event_timestamp_column` on every row for point-in-time correctness.\n",
    "  - Optionally you can track `created_timestamp_column` for lineage. We added both: `timestamp` (event time) and `created` (load time).\n",
    "\n",
    "- FileSource\n",
    "  - Points Feast to the Parquet file and tells it which columns represent the event/created timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entity and Fields\n",
    "  - `patient` is the entity (join key) using `patient_id`.\n",
    "  - `cp`, `thalach`, `ca`, `thal` are `Field` definitions which describe feature names and dtypes.\n",
    "  - Use Int32/Int64 for integer-coded features; use Float32/Float64 for continuous features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- FeatureView\n",
    "  - Groups the schema (`[cp, thalach, ca, thal]`), the entity (`patient`), and the source (`data_source`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- FeatureStore.apply\n",
    "  - Applies the definitions to a Feast repo (expects a `feature_store.yaml` in the repo path).\n",
    "  - If you don't have one yet, run:\n",
    "    - `pip install feast`\n",
    "    - `feast init cardiocare_repo`\n",
    "    - `cd cardiocare_repo && feast apply`\n",
